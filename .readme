# Project Title

This project is a MATLAB application for audio signal processing.

## Description

This project includes scripts for loading and processing audio data, calculating the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), and visualizing the results.

## Installation

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.

## Usage

To run the main script, use the following command in MATLAB:

```matlab
main

This will prompt you to enter a recording number. The script will then load and process the audio data for all digits (0-9) for the specified recording.

## Scripts

Ex5.asv: This script prepares the data and calculates the spectrum of the audio signal using different windowing techniques.
Ex6.asv: This script is currently empty.
main.m: This is the main script that loads and processes the audio data.
main.asv: This script is similar to main.m but also includes additional user prompts and a different plot.
